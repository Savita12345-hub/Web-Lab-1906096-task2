			<p style="font-size: 22px;">Version control is important for documents that undergo a lot of revision and redrafting and is particularly important for electronic documents because they can easily be changed by a number of different users. These changes may not be immediately apparent.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A version control system allows users to keep track of the changes in software development projects and enable them to collaborate on those projects. Using it, the developers can work together on code and separate their tasks through branches.
                <li>There can be several branches in a version control system, according to the number of collaborators. The branches maintain individuality as the code changes remain in a specified branch(s).</li>
                <li>evelopers can combine the code changes when required. Further, they can view the history of changes, go back to the previous version(s) and use/manage code in the desired fashion.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 style="text-align: center;background-color: #b788bd;">GIT and GITHUB</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 22px;">Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface.</p>
			<ol style="color:#ab4618";>
				<li>First developed back in 2005, Git is an extremely popular version control system that is at the heart of a wide variety of high-profile projects. Git is installed and maintained on your local system (rather than in the cloud) and gives you a self-contained record of your ongoing programming versions.</li>
				<li>The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008</li>
				<li>Unlike Git, GitHub is exclusively cloud-based. Also unlike Git, GitHub is a for-profit service (although basic repository-hosting features are available at no cost to those who are willing to create a user profile, making GitHub a popular choice for open-source projects).</li>
				</ol>
				<h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #f587b8;">git commands</h2>
				<h3 style="font-size: 20px; background-color: #e3d288;">Git fork</h3>
				<p>Git Fork means you just create a copy of the main repository of a project source code to your own GitHub profile. ... Then make your changes and create a Pull Request to the main repository branch. If the Main Repository owners like your changes they will merge it to the main repository.</p>
				<h3 style="font-size: 20px; background-color: #e3d288;">git init</h3>
				<p>The git init command is used to create a new blank repository. It is used to make an existing project as a Git project. Several Git commands run inside the repository, but init command can be run outside of the repository. The git init command creates a . git subdirectory in the current working directory.</p>
				<h3 style="font-size: 20px; background-color: #e3d288;">Git commit</h3>
				<p>The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository. Note that you have to explicitly tell Git which changes you want to include in a commit before running the "git commit" command. This means that a file won't be automatically included in the next commit just because it was changed.</p>
				<h3 style="font-size: 20px; background-color: #e3d288;">Git Push</h3>
				<p>The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.</p>
